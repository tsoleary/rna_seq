# RNAseq: Transcriptomics projects
This repository contains a few different RNAseq projects

## cahan
This folder contains analysis from a whole body heat (37) and cold (4) shock of a few day old adult _Drosophila melanogaster_ for work done for the EPSCoR ThermoFly group for the Frontiers paper.

## brains
This folder contains analysis of the basal transcriptome of adult _Drosophila melanogaster_ brains that were raised at 18, 15, 30 degrees C during development. 

## brown
Analysis of the thermal data from the Brown et al. 2014 transcriptomics study.

## learn
This folder contains a bunch of scripts that I used while I was learning my way through transcriptomics.

## DGRP_GWAS
There is a folder stored locally on my computer that contains GWAS snps and analysis from the CTmin CTmax work that the folks at UKy did.
