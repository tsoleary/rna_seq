## Differential Expression

The raw reads were mapped to DM6...

RNAseq-counts of heat shock and cold shock versus the control condition were analyzed using the DESeq2 package [version X ;@Love2014]. Differential gene expression was called at an FDR of 1% (padj < 0.01). The 

## Integration with the GWAS

The top SNPs (AvgMixedPval < $10^{-4}$)â€‹ in the GWAS were annotated on flybase 5.57? The annotated genes were then mapped to the gene expression data set.
